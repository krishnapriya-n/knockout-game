# Knockout Python Game
Dice game where each player chooses a 'knockout number' - which is either a 6, 7, 8 or 9.
More than one player can choose the same number. The players take turns on throwing the dice, once for each turn. 
If the two dice numbers adds up to the number selected by the player, the player would be eliminated.
